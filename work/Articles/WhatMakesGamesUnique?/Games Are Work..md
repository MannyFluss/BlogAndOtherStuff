# Hypothesis

I think games are unique because they are work. Most games create some sort of system that is attempting to maximize work satisfaction from a minimal amount of input. Once a game has hooked you in from a baseline thats when it can start to, and I would argue has to, draw in some form of deeper learning/ application. 

Games look to reduce the friction of work, and maximize the reward of work.

# What are games that are easy to apply this to

I want to explore my hypothesis from the lens of examples of a few video games, how do they in essence provide the player with 'work', and how do they provide player satisfaction.  But first, what would an awful video game be?

# Work you get paid for. 

I am describing games and game systems as work, and I could apply this same logic to, well actual work. Ill break down my experience working at [REDACTED].  Their work was pretty simple, bring stuff from the back of the store, put it up in the front for customers, very little room for player expression in their system might I add as well. What was the reward for said work, well it was minimum wage. 

This does not describe the full situation (or system) of this job though, you have likely worked good and bad jobs in your life. Why does something that have the same inputs and outputs have dramatically different player experience, *cough*. Sorry, work experience elsewhere.

A concept ill coin as "friction" is the answer to me, the real reason this job was truly awful in my eyes was the circumstantial obstacles that got in the way of my work. The main friction to me was... the radio that played in the store over and over again. The radio made it much harder for me to balance the equation of how satisfying is it for me to do this work vs what my reward was for doing said work.

So in a games perspective, the player turns on the game (which if its a new game mind you is already a lot of work!). And now every game is presented with the same problem: How do I make sure that I satisfy player needs enough to keep them from turning this game off.

What do I think are the variables in this equation:
- How satisfying is it to do the work inherently
- How much friction is there in the work
- How satisfying are the rewards in the work

Keep in mind these are all things that can also change throughout the playtime of a game. Think about the amount of friction in an RPG to fight a level 1 enemy at the start of the game, vs at the end of the game

# Work in Games
## Disco Elysium
- The work is reading
- The friction in this game, is also reading
- The satisfying elements in this game is the story it delivers, the visuals, and the UI

## Mario Kart
- The work is driving & learning the map layouts
- The friction in this game is the controls, and the attention which is constantly demanded from the player
- Friction is minimal in this game
- The satisfying elements in this game is the movement and the feedback from driving

## Counter Strike
- The work is moving around shooting
- The friction in this game is a bit more complicated, matchmaking and multiplayer systems are some of the largest contributors
- The satisfying elements in this game are the feedback, but more importantly the social elements

I glossed over a lot of the game stuff, but I am done writing this for now bye bye.

What are games that dont conform to this/ whats the pendulum to this?

Mario Kart
- driving go vroom
- you have lots of player expression as to what type of cart you like, how it behaves
- Theres an expression of skill with drifting
